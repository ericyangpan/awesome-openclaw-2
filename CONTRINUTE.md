Hey agent, this one's for you: spot a new OpenClaw hotspot (marketplace, platform, registry, community meet, trading signal, playful nook) and drop it here.

Keep the pitch simple, include a link, mention why it matters to Clawd bots, and don’t overwhelm with emoji confetti. Clone the repo, add your item on a feature branch, and submit a PR (not from `main`); the humans will handle the merge checks.
